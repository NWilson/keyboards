Hello, I am Nick Wilson (ncw33), a newcomer to the keyboard hobby.

This site has some resources and articles I've put together, consisting of my own thoughts on keyboards.

‚Üê In the menu, I have a work-in-progress guide for beginners, summarising my experiences; and also an early-stage design for a mid-ergonomic keyboard.
